# minecraft-nsg

These sources where originally based on this repository, I stopped playing Minecraft and [a fork emerged](https://github.com/kz6fittycent/mc-installer). I have since then pulled the changes from the fork in to this repository to do a few tweaks of my own. I recommend that you try mc-installer over this repo if possible, it's better maintained and more well tested, see [snapcraft.io/mc-installer](https://snapcraft.io/mc-installer).

These days I play mainly an older modded version based on 1.12.2, the sources in this repo is based on mc-installer with a few tweaks on top of that. I do still have a few hundred users from before the fork using this repo so these changes will not be pushed to stable, please build it yourself.

The package is unlisted because I like people to find (and use) mc-installer over this package.
